# SIMPLE SHELL DESIGN FLOW

## 1. THE PROMPT
* Prompts the user to input a command to the terminal. For this purpose, instead of typing a "tetxt" prompt, as any other shell does, I'll use a symbol to denotes the prompt.
The symbol - `($) `
* Will return after every command output. See example below:
	($) `ls`
	<list of all files and directories in the pwd>
	($) 
## 2. ACCEPT COMMANDS
